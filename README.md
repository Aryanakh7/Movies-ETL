# Movies-ETL
## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create an automated pipeline that acquires new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables that can be updated and used for events such as hackathons. In order for this to be possible, the code from Wikipedia and Kaggle used in this module will need to be refactored to create one function that incorporates the Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, while performing the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
